# SIMPLE SHELL

* This shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.

* It is both an **interactive command language** and a **scripting language**, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Users type commands which get executed within the session.

###### Example:
~~~~
$pwd - to print working directory
$cd .. - to change direcory to previous directory
$echo - to print to standard output
$cat - to read a file's content
