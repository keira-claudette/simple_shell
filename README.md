# SIMPLE SHELL

* This shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. 

* It is both an **interactive command language** and a **scripting language**, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Users type commands and they are executed within the session.
